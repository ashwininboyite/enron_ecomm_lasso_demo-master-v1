Therein lies the dark side of the vice president's brand of populism. The power subsidy proposal was drafted by a Washington energy consultant who is one of Gore's closest advisers on the environment. One of the major beneficiaries of the plan would be a power company notorious for polluting the atmosphere. To close the circle, the company has used the Gore adviser as a paid consultant. In polishing up his energy program, Gore played a variation on his Los Angeles acceptance speech's populistic attack on certain categories of business that have broken no law. This time, the target was the energy industry (""Big Oil""), assailed for benefitting from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' manipulation of oil prices. But Gore is no across-the-board enemy of corporate America. He always takes care of friends. While positioning himself as the foe of Big Oil, he emerges as the friend of Big Power. In that category is American Electric Power, based in Columbus, Ohio, and one of the Midwest's biggest supplier of coal-generated power. AEP, sued by the Environmental Protection Agency last year for alleged violation of the Clear Air Act, is widely viewed as a pariah by the environmentalist movement. It is accused of running one of the dirtiest operations to generate power. AEP frequently has paid for advice from environmental advocate Kathleen A. McGinty, who has an unusual resume indeed. As senior legislative assistant for energy and environmental policy to then-Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, she quickly gained a reputation on Capitol Hill as a passionate advocate for global climate control. Gore picked her for Clinton administration posts, enabling her to affect national policy in a major way. In 1993, she was named to head the new White House Office on Environmental Policy. In 1996, she was promoted to head the Council on Environmental Quality and became a leader in trying to sell to America the massively unpopular 1997 Gore-promoted Kyoto Treaty (never considered by the Senate) to slash energy consumption. Last year, McGinty emerged as a consultant with the law and lobbying firm of Troutman Sanders. There, she has been engaged in an interesting balancing act. On the one hand, she advised AEP and the Atlanta-based Southern Co., another power giant. On the other, she moonlighted for Gore in drafting the June 27 energy plan. Since July, she has been working full time for the Democratic National Committee. Gore's plan promises to ""clean up the nation's aging power plants by using market-based enforcement and comprehensive standards to reduce pollution and increase efficiency."" It offers ""a menu of financial mechanisms"" to ""those power plants and industries that come forward with projects that promise to dramatically reduce climate and health-threatening pollution."" That means a big subsidy for electric power companies to help them clean up their plants. According to congressional energy sources, AEP would receive millions of dollars to get right environmentally. Gore always has shown ability to reward individual corporate friends while castigating big business as predators. I previously reported that he had supported permission for deep oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, desired only by Occidental Petroleum Corp., the source of much of his family's wealth. But federal help for Occidental and American Power and the potential for conflicts of interest fly beneath the radar in a capital where the hands of neither political party are clean. It is possible for Gore's diluted brand of populism to flourish because it is the way Washington works.",0

The MSC Selection Committee is comprised of Frank Wolak, Chair of the MSC; Severin Borenstein, Director of the Energy Institute at the University of California; and Anjali Sheffrin, the ISO's Director of Market Analysis. The selection committee will conduct an extensive review of each candidate's independence and qualifications and compose a short recommendation list for the two additional member positions on the MSC. In order to meet the goal of presenting a final recommendation list of 5 candidates to the ISO CEO by December 21, 2001, from which the ISO CEO will select the two candidates for ratification as new members by the Governing Board on January 24, 2002, all nominations need to be submitted to the MSC Selection Committee by November 21, 2001.

111,"The CAISO recently filed Amendment 30, which would provide the CAISO with the authority to engage in forward contracts/purchasing, etc. to meet reliability requirements. This filing is in response to the language in the FERC San Diego Order which suggested that the FERC believes the CAISO should have this authority. Clearly, this raises issues about the role of the CAISO in the forward markets as a policy matter, but FERC is likely to approved this authority anyway. The CAISO Board is addressing this matter as part of its Comprehensive Market Reform Project. The CAISO Board at the September 7 meeting deferred the issues of the 2-day ahead market (as well as the policy matter of the CAISO buying forward) until the October meeting. However, later during Executive Session, the CAISO Board apparently approved Amendment 30. At this point in time, IEP is not planning on responding to Amendment 30. This position is primarily driven by limited funds in the Restructuring/Transmission Task Force account and, given the forces aligned in support, taking this issue up seem problematic.

I believe that your remarks, along with those of Goran Lindahl, Dick Foster, and Phil Condit of Boeing, have caused a significant stir in the preparation for the congressionally mandated Quadrennial Defense Review and the Secretary's transformation planning. I also can tell you that the feedback from participants regarding your briefing has been terrific. We are reviewing all the material this week to begin the process of re-creating the session on the Secretary's webpage for the Forum, and I will be going over the video and audio clips for posting. Recognizing that your slides were proprietary, it would be most valuable if we could post as much of your powerpoint briefing as possible--whatever you feel comfortable with sharing. Whatever that turns out to be, if your staff could email that to me, I will make sure that only that, and not the original that you sent to me, gets posted. I am not sure where the senior leadership of the DoD will be going in the coming months, however, I know that the discussion of your experience at Enron and the experiences of your panel mates will have an influence. A more formal letter of thanks will be forthcoming, but for now, thank you again for joining us and helping to make this a memorable and most important Highlands Forum.

I have not reviewed the details or the (one-RAC) structure with any of the other RAC or risk management functions - please do not distribute yourselves as I'd like to ""cushion"" the reception. Review meetings with these functions begins tomorrow (Tuesday), when I meet with: ? Dave Gorte, ? Bill Bradford and Molly Harris ? Sally Beck's group (Beth Apollo and James New) ? Treasury (Perkins and later, Despain) ? Internal Audit (Kilchrist) ? Legal (Sayre/Taylor) I'll wait to hear from David/Ted tomorrow morning as to whether I should provide a complete draft to any of these other functions or to Rick Buy at this point, or if I should wait until later in the week when we've all had the opportunity to review. As I turn around the next draft, I'll work on a power point presentation for use in the executive meetings beginning the last week of June (Business Unit Offices of the Chairman, Whalley, Causey, Fastow, Skilling). I made a quick summary of changes in the document attached below; going forward I will refine this and perhaps red-line the current policy to assist our detailed review. Thanks for your help, Cassandra.",0

SB 28x (Sher/Battin) makes various changes to the siting process including many IEP-sponsored proposals. As you will recall, two new provisions were added to the bill at the last minute before going to the Assembly Floor dealing with both retrofit schedules and environmental dispatch of generating facilities. Per the direction from IEP member companies, IEP has decided not to negotiate on the environmental dispatch issue. If the provision remained in the bill, IEP would continue to push the Republicans to hold their opposed position. We were, however, given the authority to negotiate on the retrofit issue as long as we were only talking about facilities that already have retrofit requirements. I will be faxing out the agreed upon language which in essence says the ARB shall set a schedule for the completion of any mandated retrofits. It does not expand the authority of the air districts and ARB to mandate retrofits under existing law. The schedule would require completion of the retrofits by July 1, 2004 or such later date as the ISO determines is necessary to maintain reliability. With these amendments, including some clean-up language, SB 28x will be voted-on on the Assembly floor on Monday and go to the Senate for concurrence on Tuesday. The final version will include the following IEP-sponsored proposals: ? Conforming the timing of offsets for power plants to Clean Air Act requirements ? Substituting CEQA-style hearings for the trial-like proceedings of the CE= C ? Streamlining the permit process for the modernization of existing power plant sites ? Giving consideration to the positive environmental impacts of a proposed project. ? Improving the timeliness and coordination of state and local agency review. ? Extending the current deadlines for the expedited review process established in AB 970. Since SB 28x is only a first step in making changes to the siting process, IEP member should now be thinking about what is next. IEP proposals still on the table include: ? Permitting local agencies to make zoning changes or other decisions for power plants contingent upon CEC CEQA Compliance ? Giving deference to other state and regional agencies ? Easing the threshold for override of local land use requirements. ? Making the ISO responsible for determining interconnection requirements -- Bad news on the =01&California First=018 issue quickly followed the good= news. The CEC staff analysis which said the State can't require builders of new power plants to sell electricity here, even as a trade-off for expedited permitting, was countered by another staff analysis that says the state can= . Both documents cannot be obtained due to attorney-client privilege. This issue is coming to a head next week with a decision pending by the CEC to include a California First clause on the approval of an expedited AES power plant project. AB 60x (Hertzberg), which ties to the siting process the requirement that a developer enter into a contract to sell power to specified California entities, is still poised to be heard in the Senate Energy committee. IEP members company lobbyist should continue to lobby against this measure regardless of the CEC=01,s decision on AES, although our arguments are definitely strengthened if the addition of the clause at the CEC is denied. -- IEP has finalized negotiations with Senator Burton=01,s office on amendm= ents attempting to solve our problem with the eminent domain provision in SB 6x (Burton), which is the State Power Authority measure. Attached is a copy o= f the bill in PDF form. The agreed upon language, which clarifies that the Authority=01,s purpose is to supplement existing generation activities, can= be found on pages 6-7 (Section 3310), 13 (Section 3341.1) and 16-17 (Section3352). Considering the inflammatory remarks made by Senator Burton in the press lately regarding seizing generation assets, this was most likely the best we could get. -- The first of Senator Dunn=01,s hearings with the Senate Select Committee= to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Market occurred this week. This week and next week=01,s topics will be to go over previous investigati= ons into market power. The committee heard or will be hearing testimony from: Frank Wolak, Chairman Market Surveillance Committee, CAISO; Eric Hildebrandt, Manager Market Monitoring, CAISO; and, Elaine Howle, State Auditor. -- The Assembly Electricity Oversight Subcommittee met this week and focused on the issue of natural gas collusion. Testifying before the committee were representatives from Dynegy and El Paso, commenting on the rise of natural gas prices and whether illegal market manipulation and collusion occurred. The subcommittee plans on putting together a package o= f bills related to natural gas issues, which would be the culmination of the committee=01,s hearings over the last two months. This package will be up = for consideration first by the whole special Assembly Energy committee. -- Governor Davis came out this week supporting the construction of the Calpine Metcalf Energy Center, the 600-megawatt power plant proposed for th= e San Jose region. The Governor urged the CEC to approve the plant siting so that construction can begin. -- Two long-term contracting bills are scheduled for hearings next week. IEP counsel is currently reviewing AB 57 (Wright) and SB 997 (Morrow) and will comment on their provisions as soon as possible. -- Attached is the most recent legislative tracking reports, both the special session and regular session.

157,"While I appreciate the virtue of flying below the radar if possible, the matter here is complicated by the fact that FERC's discovery rules (18 CFR, Subpart D) pertain only to ""proceedings set for hearing . . . and to such proceedings as the Commission may order."" 18 CFR 385.401. In this case, FERC stated that ""a trial-type hearing is not necessary . . . ."" and specifically rejected the use of a ""trial-type evidentiary hearing."" Slip op. at 47-48 & n.97. Thus, while I have not researched the matter as yet, my preliminary view is that the CPUC's attempt to invoke FERC's discovery processes would appear to be outside the contemplation of FERC's Nov. 1 order and its regulations, unless FERC specifically orders discovery in this case. (The CPUC seems to recognize the relevance of this consideration when it specifically attempts to equate ""paper"" hearings with ""trial-type"" hearings; see page 1 of its Motion.) The CPUC's motion may prompt FERC to decide whether or not to allow discovery in this case under Rule 401. While the CPUC's motion does not apply directly to marketers, FERC's ruling will be precedent in the event the CPUC or someone else hereafter serves discovery on other parties. As a result, we need to consider whether laying in the weeds risks losing an opportunity to present our views on whether FERC should allow discovery in a paper hearing with an expedited decisional track, particularly in light of the fact that Staff has already conducted. >>> Jeffrey Watkiss 11/08/00 10:31AM >>> Does anyone have an idea as to why marketers, including EPMI, are not included in the list of subject companies: Exh. B? Since EPMI is not a subject of the motion, why should it answer? Lying in the weeds may be a more prudent course of action. >>> ""Fergus, Gary S."" <GFergus@brobeck.com> 11/07/00 10:08PM >>> I just spoke with Mary to make sure we have the same information. Here are the facts we have so far. On November 4th, the CPUC filed a motion with FERC to adopt the form of protective order that the CPUC entered, to compel the production of documents and to shorten time to answer. According to Exhibit B (read to me by Nancy Pickover at Bracewell) the following CPUC moved against the following entities: AES, Williams, Duke, Dynegy, Reliant and Southern. Enron entities were NOT named in exhibit B. This is not to say that we could not be easily added to the group. While the motion reads as if the CPUC was moving against everybody, in fact, in footnote 2 they state they are only moving against the entities named in Exhibit B. We will have Exhibit B in hand first thing tomorrow via FEDEX to confirm this. To repeat, Enron is not named yet.

Given the timing, we should discuss this on our conference call scheduled for tomorrow. They request that we be required: to answer their motion on Thursday, to provide the information within 5 working days of a FERC ordering production, and to provide of P&L information and spread sheets detailing our deals, specifically delivery point, delivery date, counterparty, volume and price. We may not have a problem providing this information for use by FERC in its proceeding subject to a confidentiality agreement but I think we would oppose their requests for: the information to be provided for ""government eyes only"" - this would prohibit EPMI from defending itself vis-a-vis other market participants. a FERC confidentiality order that would could allow FERC to ""share"" this information with the CPUC (for purposes of the PUC's OII proceeding) pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 824h(c). 16 USC 824g(c) requires the Commission to make information available to state commissions as may be of assistance in state regulation of public utilities. We should argue that 16 USC 824h(c) does not apply here given that we are not a public utility nor does the PUC regulate how much market power wholesale marketers exercise or the level of market power mitigation (these are the bases the PUC provides for explaining why it should have this information.) the above contractual information to allow them to analyze the competitiveness of the forward market to evaluate the wisdom of the Commission's decision to allow the UDC's ""unfettered access"" to the forwards market. This argument is unpersuasive given that the CPUC can get information about the competitiveness of the forward markets from the Wall Street Journal's listing of NYMEX prices.

But he also said there is a right way and a wrong way to do it. Enron and others had provided a market based answer by offering a fixed price deal to SDG&E (which would have enabled them to cap rates to those who had not switched. California elected instead to cap rates and deficit spend (ie create a deferral account). I don't think we can stand for anything that doesn't protect the small customers, but we can continue to emphasize the market based solutions. One of the messages in my testimony will be: customers should be encouraged to choose. Those who did are doing fine.",0

1531,"Mike, Richard, and Gary: What I was suggesting was that we would produce the limited items that we are proposing under the terms of the existing protective order (which are inadequate, but we are not giving up any of the crown jewels at this point) while conditioning our production on two points, first, that we reserve the right to seek stronger protection in the order (a la Williams' motion) for any subsequent materials we do agree to produce or which are compelled to be produced, and two, that the materials we are currently producing which are entitled to confidentiality (the trading data at a minimum) shall be subject to the most stringent protective order which the Commission issues in this proceeding, i.e., we get the benefit of any additional protections Williams can secure. I only suggest this so we can stay out of the limelight by not being one of the ""bad guy"" generators who are actively taking on the protective order, when we know that at least four generators are producing nothing until their motion is resolved, and one marketer (Coral/Shell Energy) has refused to produce transactional data and has objected to most of the document request. I have also recently learned that Calpine has gotten an extension until Oct. 13 and will try to delay and hold off producing much data. I will get getting a copy of Coral's objections to the commission shortly.

Enron entities were NOT named in exhibit B. This is not to say that we could not be easily added to the group.

Portland, Ore.-Based Firm Says California Has Capacity for Electricity Needs Dan McSwain , North County Times, Escondido, Calif. ( October 17, 2000 ) Oct. 13--PORTLAND, Ore.--A private investigation of state power markets has come to the conclusion that California had plenty of electricity generating capacity this summer. The state enjoyed a 32 percent reserve margin even as wholesale prices soared and the state's power manager declared 36 separate ""power emergencies"" because California was thought to be in the grips of a critical shortage, according to the investigation. The author of the investigation's preliminary report, Portland-based economist and utility industry consultant Robert McCullough, said at a conference of analysts, power traders and electricity industry regulators Thursday that he has found evidence that generators and trading companies manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a false shortage and push up prices. The Encina power plant in Carlsbad provides a stark example: it ran at well below its full capacity for much of June, even though wholesale power prices ---- and consumer electricity bills ---- shot to well above the generating plant's cost of production. The actual production of electricity by the plants was determined by an analysis of data from the Environmental Protection Agency, which monitors emissions. ""We are seeing a lot of under-generation,"" McCullough said. ""This is market power in action."" Market power is a term used by economists to describe the ability of market participants -- in this case suppliers -- to influence prices. Many of the industry experts present at the conference Thursday reaffirmed their belief that supply shortages were very real this summer, and contributed to high prices, but several participants said deregulation has reduced the amount of market information that is available to analysts. Mainstream economists have questioned the accuracy of data from federal agencies, including the EPA. Conventional explanations for the low energy production observed in San Diego County are scant. Encina's operators, a joint venture of energy giants Dynegy Inc. and NRG Energy Inc. called Cabrillo Power, confirmed that the power plant had no abnormal maintenance problems. The San Diego Regional Air Quality Board said Wednesday that the power plant was well within its state-mandated pollution limits. But David Lloyd, the corporate secretary of Cabrillo, denied that the Encina plant has been used to game the San Diego County power markets. ""That can't possibly be right,"" Lloyd said of McCullough's analysis. ""In North County, we were right on the ragged edge of being off (an emergency shutdown because of heavy output). ""Without knowing the specific details of time and which units were on or off, I can't comment,"" Lloyd said. ""We certainly don't want to be accused of anything wrongful,"" he said. ""We don't have that much power in California, and for us to be shutting down in California to push up the price somewhere else doesn't make sense for us. We want to run all we can when the prices are high."" Electricity prices have soared to record levels since May, resulting in a doubling and tripling of power bills this summer for the 1.2 million customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and causing an estimated $5 billion in losses for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. State lawmakers have intervened on behalf of San Diego County consumers with a retail rate cap, but the law in turn created a looming IOU that could grow beyond $300 million if high wholesale prices persist. No fewer than five private, state and federal investigations are under way to assess the competitiveness of power markets in the interconnected Western states. The investigations also seek to answer charges that the companies which produce and trade electricity have either figured out how to exploit deregulated markets to outmaneuver regulators or have engaged in outright manipulation in order to increase profits. Inquiries by the California Public Utilities Commission, Electricity Oversight Board and attorney general, along with a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission investigation, were launched in July and August. Staff investigators of the state and federal commissions said this week that they are still in the process of issuing subpoenas and gathering market data. McCullough was hired in late May by the Seattle city utility and a consortium of large industrial power consumers in the Pacific Northwest to investigate the price spikes. His effort is thought to be the first to complete an exhaustive analysis of state and federal information that tracks the amount of electricity that was available and compares it to the amount of power that was actually used. Chief among McCullough's findings was that demand for power was lower this summer than what was forecasted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council, a federal agency that is charged with ensuring the stability of the vast web of power transmission lines that connect California to 13 other Western states, British Columbia and northern Mexico. McCullough provided a copy of his preliminary findings Tuesday to the North County Times, and the initial reaction of the state's energy community was one of deep skepticism. ""EPA data is notoriously unreliable,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford professor and the chairman of the market surveillance committee of the California Independent System Operator, the agency that manages the state grid and which has paid enormous sums for emergency power this summer. To gauge the actual output of power plants that burn fossil fuel, McCullough used emissions data from the EPA. ""Greed would get the best of anybody,"" Wolak said. ""I found a lot of hours where in-state generators were exceeding nameplate capacity. These guys were cranking it out."" Wolak, in a study of power markets for the system operator, did conclude, however, that exercise of market power by power generators and traders was the major cause of higher prices this summer. At the conference in Portland, most of the panelists did not openly criticize McCullough's analysis, but implicitly disputed his conclusions by attributing higher prices and the presumed exercise of market power to a very real shortage of electricity generating capacity among the Western states. Low hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest and high temperatures in the Southwest were blamed for limiting California's ability to import electricity. Others said state and federal regulators, along with market participants themselves, won't really know what happened until more experts look at hard market information that is in short supply. Ron Eachus, the chairman of the Oregon Public Utilities Commission, said market information is routinely withheld from regulators, the public and buyers of electricity, but is shared among power generators and trading companies. ""If the market is sharing it with themselves, but not us, I don't buy that,"" Eachus said. Tim Belden is the vice president of West Trading for Enron North America, the largest marketer and trader of electricity in the world. Enron takes the unique stand that more information which has been labeled ""proprietary"" by companies, such as when a plant is being run and how much the electricity is selling for, should be made available instantly to the markets. ""Is there a smoking gun out there or are market participants behaving rationally?"" Belden said. ""California is characterized by secret, black box market models that nobody understands,"" he said.

139,"FYI. From today's Post. Davis seems to continue to put distance between himself and the contracts. Best, Jeff Financial California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks Peter Behr ? 07/06/2001 The Washington Post FINAL Page E01 Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. ""We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion,"" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. ""You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion."" The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. ""What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,"" Wagner told reporters. ""In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment."" The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a ""joke"" that the parties might as well wear ""clown suits,"" according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile ""spot market"" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a ""refund"" because the deals were reached ""under commercial duress,"" according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. ""There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,"" said Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a ""just and reasonable"" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. ""It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room ""billions of dollars apart,"" as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said.",0

CASE SETTING: 2000, U.S. In October 2000, the chief financial officer of Pacific Northwest Electric (PNW) is considering whether to use weather derivatives to reduce the weather-related risk in the volume of megawatt hours (MWh) sold. The (A) case may be used to stimulate student discussion of how the derivative contracts work, why one might want or not want to take such a contract, and how one would decide whether to use the weather protection. No prior exposure to options or derivatives is needed for this discussion; indeed, the case may be used as an introduction to options. The (B) case involves valuing the available contracts and deciding, which, if any, is the best contract for PNW. Spreadsheet simulation can be used to determine the probability distribution of the payout of the contract and the probability distribution for the net operating contribution including the contract payout, which is the basis for comparing alternatives. It is instructive for the students to think about what would be the ideal contract to reduce exposure to the greatest intent. This pushes students towards the optimal hedge ratio. Specific learning objectives of these cases include these: - to expose students to the cutting edge in financial innovation - to illustrate the use of options to reduce business risk - to challenge the students to value options where the Black-Scholes model cannot be used, and simulation can be readily employed - to experience the perspective of top management in risk management activities.

382,"Larry, Thanks -----Original Message----- From: LawrenceLRTNMT@aol.com@ENRON Sent: Wednesday, June 27, 2001 6:40 AM To: Kaminski, Vince J Subject: Patent attorney Vince: I wanted to get back to you with a reply to your question about my recommendation on a patent attorney. I cannot give you a personal recommendation per se because, in the end, I opted not to hire an attorney to file my patent until I had decided whether I wanted to protect my work as a trade secret or as a patented commodity. I ultimately struck a compromise position by filing my own ""provisional patent application."" This establishes the date of my claim and gives me one year in which to finalize the patent? or not; it also provides patent pending protection from the date I filed it with the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office. In the process of investigating the options for safeguarding my intellectual property, however, I did talk to quite a number of patent attorneys. Of these, I think that perhaps David Richie might be the most appropriate for your son's software idea. He talked as though he had a particular specialty in software issues; he also struck me as competent and aggressive. He practices in the Silicon Valley and can be reached at telephone number (408) 282-1856. I suspect that he has already done so, but if not, your son might want to visit the internet site of the U. S. Patent Office. Basic information and forms can be downloaded from there. Two other, newer sites might also intrigue him-both deal with the protection, valuation and marketing of intellectual property, patents, etc. They are: pl-x.com (The Patent and License Exchange, Inc.) yet2come.com Hope this is helpful.

75,"I have taken a stab at putting a draft response together, indicating areas where we need more flesh. I will forward Tim/Mary's presentation to FERC, EPSA's California Fact Sheet and the transcript from the hearing held on 8/23 and 8/24. Witness Wolak, Market Surveillance Committee of ISO, had some good points about rational behavior in markets with scarcity of supply. His comments were on 8/23. Please feel free to comment. Dan Douglass, Arter&Hadden (818-596-2201) will be filing these comments on Enron's behalf, which are due on Friday. I would suggest that Dan provide some of the legal view on whether the CPUC has adequate jurisdiction over retail rates, not wholesale rates. We should shoot for final comments by 10:00 a.m. tomorrow, if possible. This will allow an opportunity to discuss any last minute changes, if necessary before filing. Seabron Adamson, Frontier Economics (617-354-0060), will be providing additional drafting. Be sure to send any comments to these parties along with the internal list. Thanks.",0
166,"All, Lee asked me to forward this. I'm still awaiting additional suggestions from anyone on speakers. I guess Lee's e-mail changes things. If the business school wants to go forward with a conference anyway then it may be a bad idea to have a separate one. Jeff has said he likes the idea of coordinating. Bill and Allen, what do you think? I will chime in that Carl Shapiro is very much a big wig, as a former chief economist at DOJ. As for the Frank Wolak suggestion, Frank is a Stanford economist who is an outstanding analyst and has published probably more than anyone else on electricity market design performance, regarding the UK, Australia, and California. He speaks a mile a minute though and his understanding of policy and politics is a bit naive. I should note that ICF will not be able to contribute. I heard from Michael Berg this morning. So he will not be participating in our discussions either. My opinion is let's do whatever is best for the school. One positive outcome of this would be stronger relationships with some of the University's top notch economic policy faculty. Overshadowing is possible.

First, I apologize for my prolonged recent absences. I have had two long-standing academic projects: one was due 4/19 (it was on ""final review"" - a paper about corporate political strategy - and just was accepted for publication at our top academic journal) and another is due 5/31. The 5/31 paper was commissioned long ago but is a key paper in a June conference (topic is methods to study corporate political activities and the public affairs function). In order to get it done properly, I need to forego any work at Enron until later in the month. A project of interest to me at Enron - and I hope one that you also have interest - is assessing the effectiveness of governmental affairs. John told me that he conducted such a study for the group last year. One of the methodological challenges is to calculate the benefits that government affairs brings - especially in a system where, for example, on the legislative side, much of the ""work"" of government affairs is to block legislation at very early stages. I suspect that govt. affairs needs to justify its existence for internal budgets at Enron and thus the benefits of the function are important to quantify. I'd like to review any of the previous work and make suggestions as necessary. At some point, let me know how you would like to proceed. Otherwise, I hope all is well with you all.
